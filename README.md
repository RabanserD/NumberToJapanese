# NumberToJapanese
Convert Arabic numbers into Japanese equivalents (Kana, Kanji, and Romanji) for easy reference and learning.

## Website
You can try out the tool directly on the live website: [https://numbertojapanese.rabanser.tech/](https://numbertojapanese.rabanser.tech/).

## Basic Functionality
This website allows you to input Arabic numbers and convert them into their Japanese equivalents in three formats:

- **Kana**: The Hiragana and Katakana representations of the number.
- **Kanji**: The traditional Japanese characters used for expressing numbers.
- **Romanji**: The Romanized (Latin alphabet) version of the number.

Simply enter a number, and the website will display the conversion in all three formats for quick and easy reference, making it a useful tool for learning and understanding Japanese number systems.
